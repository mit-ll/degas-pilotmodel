# UAS Pilot Model v6.1

This folder contains the UAS Pilot Model block and unit test to be used in conjunction with the DEGAS baseline simulation, [`degas-core`](https://github.com/mit-ll/degas-core).
For information regarding the design and development of the Pilot Model, see [A Model of Unmanned Aircraft Pilot Detect and Avoid Maneuver Decisions](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1080987.pdf).

The Pilot Model is intended to be used in conjunction with a decision support algorithm such as NASA's DAIDALUS. DEGAS uses [`DAIDALUS v2.0.1c`](https://github.com/nasa/daidalus/tree/DAIDALUSv2.0.1c).

Before using DEGAS, ensure that this folder and any sub-folders are added to the MATLAB path. Directions on how to do this
can be found in the *Quickstart* section of the DEGAS README located in the DEGAS folder.
